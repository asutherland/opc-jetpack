    <p>Welcome to the Jetpack API tutorial. By the end of this
    tutorial, you'll have learned how to make a Jetpack Feature that
    removes all embeds &mdash; Flash movies, etc &mdash; from a
    particular page or all websites. The code required is never more
    lines than a polydactylic man can count on both hands.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 0: Get going</h2>

    <p>One of the primary goals of Jetpack is to have development be a
    real-time adventure. We know that tight feedback loops, a good
    debugger, and instant gratification makes for happy coders. That's
    why refreshing a Jetpack Feature is literally as simple as
    refreshing a webpage, and why we try to have all errors be
    reported sensibly and with line number!</p>

    <p>Before we get started, you should know that this tutorial is
    actually interactive: if you click on one of the code snippets,
    it'll automatically install itself as a Jetpack feature and become
    editable, at which point you can tinker with the code to see what
    it does in real time. If you mess anything up, just reload this
    page to undo it.</p>

    <p>Let's get going. Remember that you can also always check out the
      <span class="tab-link" name="api">API Reference</a>.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: The boom stick</h2>

    <p>Admit it. Have you always wanted a button in your browser that
    let's you make things go boom? I know I have. So that's the first
    thing that we are going to make. Let's begin by adding a widget to
    the status bar that contains the prophetic message "Boom!":</p>

    <div class="example">
jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: "Boom<i>!</i>"
});</div>

    <p>Just click the above code, and there it is, large as life
    in the status bar. Notice the conspicuous lack of restarts! As you
    can see, <code>statusBar.append</code> takes an options
    object. Instead of passing in html, you can use the
    <code>url</code> keyword and pass it a relative url.</p>

    <p>Right now the widget is probably way too wide &mdash; that's
    because we haven't yet added the auto-sizing feature to
    Jetpack. For now, you'll have to pass in the width.</p>

    <div class="example">
jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: "Boom<i>!</i>",
  width: 45
});</div>

    <p>That's nice, but just having a "Boom!" in your status bar isn't
    all that exciting. Let's make it <i>do</i> something.</p>

    <div class="example">
jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: "Boom<i>!</i>",
  width: 45,
  onReady: function(widget){
    $(widget).click(function(){
      console.log( jetpack.tabs );
    });
  }
});</div>

    <p>Now, whenever you click on the widget, it logs the
    <code>jetpack.tabs</code> object to the Firebug console. Instead
    of reinventing the wheel, to debug Jetpack Features we've made
    Firebug the tool of choice. It's easy to introspect to learn more
    &mdash; for instance by delving in, you'll quickly find the
    <code>jetpack.tabs.focused</code> object, which gives you access
    to the currently active tab.</p>

    <p>You can also see that we've automatically included jQuery by
    default&mdash;if you're unfamiliar with it, that's what the
    <tt>$</tt> function is all about, and you can learn more by
    reading the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page">jQuery
    Documentation</a>. In the future, we hope to include other
    libraries. Feel free to fiddle around with the code, and see what
    you come up with.</p>

    <p>Let's make our little Boom! widget do something more fun:</p>

    <div class="example">
jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: "Boom<i>!</i>",
  width: 45,
  onReady: function(widget){
    $(widget).click(function(){
      jetpack.notifications.show( "Booming!" );
      $(jetpack.tabs.focused.contentDocument)
        .find("body")
        .css({backgroundColor:"blue"})
        .animate({opacity:.5});
    });
  }
});</div>

    <p>Give it a go and see what it does. Every <code>tab</code>
    object has a wealth of possible event listeners, and
    properties. Take a look via Firebug or check out the <a
    href="file.html#index.html">documentation</a>. Just like an
    iframe, one of the properties is <code>contentDocument</code>,
    which gives you access to the the equivalent of the document for
    the page in the specified tab. Alternatively, you can use
    <code>contentWindow</code> to get access to the object which
    houses the page's <code>.alert()</code> function, and so
    forth.</p>

    <p>When you want a light-weight way to inform your users of a bit
    of information, <code>jetpack.notifications.show()</code> may be
    the way to go. On Windows and Linux, these show up as <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(computing)">toast
    notifications</a> and on OS X as <a
    href="http://growl.info/">Growl notifications</a>.</p>

    <p>Let's turn away from our new-found ability to make pages blue,
    and instead to the ability to remove embeds from a page. It's one
    line of jQuery goodness.</p>

    <div class="example">
jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: "Boom<i>!</i>",
  width: 45,
  onReady: function(widget){
    $(widget).click(function(){
      var doc = jetpack.tabs.focused.contentDocument;
      $(doc).find("embed").remove();
    });
  }
});</div>


    <p>Pretty good, huh? Less than ten lines of code gets us an
    on-demand embed killer.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2: Distributing the boom</h2>
    
    <p>So you've got your feature written and you want to release it to the
    world. It's very easy to do &mdash; there's no special build step,
    or odd file format. All you need to do is drop the code in a file,
    let's call it "boom.js". Then in any page you want the feature to be
    installable, you add:</p>

    <p><code>&lt;link rel="jetpack" href="boom.js" name="Boom!"/&gt;</code>
    </p>

    <p>to the header. That's it. When you navigate to the page, a notification bar will
    drop down with the option to install the feature.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: The automatic boom</h2>

    <p>We can now get rid of embeds on demand, but that requires
    clicking the Boom! button on every page. What if we instead wanted
    to to enable/disable the functionality for all sites? That's where
    the magic of <code>jetpack.tabs.onReady</code> comes in. It allows
    you to code on every navigation action, just a new page loads but
    before iframes, images, and scripts are fetched. To wait until
    everything is loaded, you can use
    <code>jetpack.tabs.onLoad</code>. Jetpack takes care of all the
    difficult edge cases, like dealing with multiple windows and new
    tabs. Jetpack also handles removing event handlers when you reload
    a Jetpack Feature, so that you never have to restart Firefox due
    to errant event handlers.</p>

    <div class="example">
function removeEmbeds(doc){
  $(doc).find("embed").remove();
}

jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: 'Boom?<input type="checkbox">',
  width: 70,
  onReady: function(widget){
    $("input", widget).click(function(){
      if( this.checked ){
        jetpack.tabs.onReady( removeEmbeds );
        removeEmbeds(jetpack.tabs.focused.contentDocument);
      }
      else jetpack.tabs.onReady.unbind( removeEmbeds );
    });
  }
});</div>

    <p>One of the neat additions we've made is how you remove an event
    handler. Instead of passing in a string, you just call the
    <code>unbind</code> function which is a property of the event
    handling function.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: Libraries</h2>

    <p>Reusable code is at the heart of any good API. That's why
    Jetpack includes a "standard library" of common web APIs. At the
    moment, we've only implemented a Twitter library. In the future,
    there should be many more, including the ability to import
    libraries not included with Jetpack by default. (And for
    developers to contribute their APIs for others to use.)</p>

    <p>Here's a simple Jetpack Feature that shows the Twitter library
    in use. It allows you to be notified of someone's latest
    Tweet.</p>

    <div class="example">
var twitter = jetpack.lib.twitter
var oldTweet = null;

function getTweet() {
  twitter.statuses.user_timeline({
    id: "osunick",
    success: function (tweets) {
      var newTweet = tweets[0].text;
      if( oldTweet != newTweet )
        jetpack.notifications.show( newTweet );
      oldTweet = newTweet;
    }
  });
}

getTweet();
setInterval( getTweet, 1000*60 );
</div>

    <p>Jetpack is smart enough to clear any <code>setInterval</code>'s
    or <code>setTimeout</code>'s that you use when you refresh your
    Jetpack.</p>

    <p>For now, the easiest way to get documentation on the Twitter
    library is to read the <a
    href="file.html#index.html#content/js/twitter.js">commented
    source</a>.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5: Email notifier</h2>

    <p>Putting it all together, you should now be able to be able to
    read through the following example, which displays the number of
    unread emails in your inbox. The only new API calls here are
    <code>jetpack.tabs.open(url)</code> and
    <code>tab.focus()</code>.</p>

    <div class="example">
function GmailNotifier(doc){
  $(doc).click( this.goToInbox );
  this.update( doc );
  setInterval( function(){
    this.update(doc);
  }, 60*1000 );
}

GmailNotifier.prototype = {
  goToInbox: function(){
    jetpack.tabs.open("http://mail.google.com");
    jetpack.tabs[ Jetpack.tabs.length-1 ].focus();
  },
  
  update: function(doc){
    var url = "http://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom";
    doc = $(doc);
    $.get( url, function(xml){
      var el = $(xml).find("fullcount"); // Unread message count

      if( el ){
        var count = el.get(0).textContent;
        doc.find("#count").text( count );
      }
      else{
        doc.find("#count").text( "Login" );
      }
    });
  }
}

jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: '<img src="http://mail.google.com/mail/images/favicon.ico"/><span id="count"></span>',
  onReady: function(doc){
    var gmail = new GmailNotifier(doc);
    $("#count", doc).css({
      position: "absolute",
      left: 4, top: 8,
      fontSize: "10px",
      cursor: "pointer",
      backgroundColor: "rgba(255,255,255,.8)"
    });
  },
  width: 20
});</div>
