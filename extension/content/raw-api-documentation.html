  <div name="globals">
    <h3>The Global Namespace</h3>
    The global namesace of a Jetpack feature is where most of
    its functionality can be found. Special care has been taken
    to make this namespace look and function as much like a Web page's
    global namespace as possible.
  <div name="XMLHttpRequest" class="property">
    <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> provides an easy way to retrieve data at a
    URL. Check out
    its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XmlHttpRequest">reference
    documentation</a> for more information.
    <p>
    Unlike the class of the same name available to web content, the
    <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object available to Jetpacks can access
    data at any domain.
    <p>
    Note that <tt>jQuery</tt> is also available to Jetpacks, and it
    provides a very simple API to <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt>
    functionality.  See
    the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax">jQuery Ajax
    documentation</a> for more information.
  </div>
  <div name="jetpack" class="property">
    The <tt>jetpack</tt> namespace is available to all Jetpack
    Features, and is the main point of contact for Features with the
    rest of Firefox. The API is intended as a lightweight
    backwards-compatible facade to the underlying Mozilla platform,
    which means that if you write a Feature using the Jetpack library,
    you won't have to change your code as Firefox continues to evolve.
    <div name="slideBar" class="property">
      This object contains methods relevant to the Jetpack-added SlideBar that
      appears at the left side of the browser window when the user's pointer
      moves towards the icon on the left of the tab-strip. Features can add an
      icon and have the SlideBar open to display additional content and then
      slide away when the user returns to the page.
      <p>
      This slideBar object is currently experimental, so load it with:
      <div class="example">
jetpack.future.import("slideBar");
      </div>
      <div name="append" class="property">
        <div class="argument options" name="options">
          <span class="string" name="icon">URI of the initial icon to show when
          the SlideBar is open.</span>
          <span class="string" name="html">The initial HTML contents of the new
          SlideBar feature. This can be a plain string or an E4X xml
          node.</span>
          <span class="url" name="url">The URL to load HTML contents for the
          SlideBar Feature. If the html property is set, it will be used instead
          of this.</span>
          <span class="number" name="width">Size of the content area to render
          <tt>html</tt> or <tt>url</tt>, in pixels.</span>
          <span class="function" name="onSelect">The callback function invoked
          when the icon is clicked and selected. If the feature is already
          "selected", it won't get another onSelect call. See below for the
          callback's arguments.</span>
          <span class="function" name="onReady">The callback function invoked
          when the SlideBar feature has its contents loaded. See below for the
          callback's arguments.</span>
        </div>
        This function adds an icon to the SlideBar, and it will be shown when
        the user moves towards the SlideBar icon. When the user selects a
        feature's icon, it will be "selected," and the feature can do additional
        actions such as sliding open a larger area to reveal the feature's
        contents.
        <p>
        All callback functions passed in as options will be passed a single
        function that is used to slide open the SlideBar. This function takes a
        single "options" object like the slideBar.append method; the two
        properties are <tt>size</tt> and <tt>persist</tt>. <tt>size</tt> is the
        number of pixels to slide out, and if <tt>persist</tt> is true, the
        SlideBar will stay open even if the user moves the cursor away.
        <p>
        The function passed to the callback function has two additional
        properties: <tt>icon</tt> refers to the icon in the SlideBar and
        <tt>doc</tt> refers to the content document for the feature. These are
        useful for adding listeners or dynamically changing the icon or
        document.
        <p>
        The following example adds a SlideBar feature that temporarily slides
        itself open when selected and makes itself stay open after clicking the
        content area. (To close, click the SlideBar icon.) Additionally, the
        feature will change its icon when the page is clicked.
        <div class="example">
jetpack.future.import("slideBar");
jetpack.slideBar.append({
  onSelect: function(slide) slide({ size: 100 }),
  onReady: function(slide) $(slide.doc).click(function() {
    slide({ size: 200, persist: true });
    slide.icon.src = "chrome://branding/content/icon48.png";
  })
});
        </div>
        Notice when <tt>persist</tt> is not provided to the callback function's
        argument, <tt>slide</tt>, the SlideBar actually shifts the contents of
        the browser off the right edge of the window. This is because the
        default view of the SlideBar and its features are temporary. When
        <tt>persist</tt> is true, the right edge will stay on the right side of
        the window, so if it was "off" the window before, it will slide back in.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div name="statusBar" class="property">
      This object contains methods relevant to the status bar that
      appears at the bottom of the browser window. Note that the user
      has the option to disable the display of the status bar in
      Firefox's "View" menu.
      <div name="append" class="property">
        <div class="argument options" name="options">
          <span class="string" name="html">The initial HTML contents
          of the new status bar panel.</span>
          <span class="url" name="url">The URL of the status bar
          panel's HTML contents.</span>
          <span class="number" name="width">Size of the content area to render
          <tt>html</tt> or <tt>url</tt>, in pixels.</span>
          <span class="function" name="onReady">The callback function
          to invoke when the new panel is created on a status
          bar.</span>
        </div>
        This function adds a new panel to the status bar of all
        open browser windows. When any new browser windows open,
        the panel is automatically added to them as well.
        <p>
        The following example embeds an icon into the status bar that,
        when clicked, displays a notification message to the user.
        <div class="example">
jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: '<img src="http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico">',
  width: 16,
  onReady: function(doc) {
    $(doc).find("img").click(function() {
      jetpack.notifications.show("hai2u");
      });
  }});
        </div>
        <p>
        Technically speaking, the status bar panel is an
        <tt>iframe</tt> element. While this comes at a relatively high
        resource cost, it also enables the full breadth of
        generativity that the Web has to offer. In the future, we may
        add additional parameters to this function allowing the
        addition of simpler, less resource-intensive elements such as
        static text labels and images.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div name="notifications" class="property">
      Eventually, this object will be the end-all be-all of easy
      communication with your users. Notification bars, transparent
      messages, Growls, doorknob messages, and so forth will all go
      through here. For now, it just has simple notifications.
      <div name="show" class="property">
        <div class="argument options string" name="options">
          <span class="string" name="title">The title of the notification.</span>
          <span class="url" name="icon">The URL to the notification's icon.</span>
          <span class="string" name="body">The body of the notification.</span>
        </div>
        This function displays a simple notification message. On
        Windows and Linux it's a toaster notification, and on OS X
        it's a Growl message (if Growl is installed).  Instead of
        passing in an <tt>options</tt> object, the caller can simply
        pass in a string, which is used as the <tt>body</tt> argument.
        <p>
        The following example displays a message with a title, icon,
        and body.
        <div class="example">
jetpack.notifications.show({title: 'hai2u',
                            body: 'o hai.',
                            icon: 'http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico'});

  <div name="live event binder" class="glossary">
    A <em>live event binder</em> is a method of a parent object,

    notified whenever the relevant event is fired on any member of the
    live array, <i>even if the member wasn't in the live array when
    the event binding was created</i>. For an example of this, see
    <tt>jetpack.tabs.onReady</tt>.
