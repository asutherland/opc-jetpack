  <div name="globals">
    <h3>The Global Namespace</h3>
    The global namesace of a Jetpack Feature is where most of
    its functionality can be found. Special care has been taken
    to make this namespace look and function as much like a Web page's
    global namespace as possible.
  <div name="XMLHttpRequest" class="property">
    <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> provides an easy way to retrieve data at a
    URL. Check out
    its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XmlHttpRequest">reference
    documentation</a> for more information.
    <p>
    Unlike the class of the same name available to web content, the
    <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> object available to Jetpacks can access
    data at any domain.
    <p>
    Note that <tt>jQuery</tt> is also available to Jetpacks, and it
    provides a very simple API to <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt>
    functionality.  See
    the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax">jQuery Ajax
    documentation</a> for more information.
  </div>
  <div name="jetpack" class="property">
    The <tt>jetpack</tt> namespace is available to all Jetpack
    Features, and is the main point of contact for Features with the
    rest of Firefox. The API is intended as a lightweight
    backwards-compatible facade to the underlying Mozilla platform,
    which means that if you write a Feature using the Jetpack library,
    you won't have to change your code as Firefox continues to evolve.
    <div name="selection" class="property">
      This object grants access to the user's current selection. It allows
      reading out of the selection as text or html. Additionally it allows
      Jetpack Features to listen for when the user changes selections.
      <p>
      This selection object is currently experimental, so load it with:
      <div class="example">
jetpack.future.import("selection");
      </div>
      <p>See <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/12">JEP 12:

    </div>
    <div name="slideBar" class="property">
      This object contains methods relevant to the Jetpack-added SlideBar that
      appears at the left side of the browser window when the user's pointer
      moves towards the icon on the left of the tab-strip. Features can add an
      icon and have the SlideBar open to display additional content and then
      slide away when the user returns to the page.
      <p>
      This slideBar object is currently experimental, so load it with:
      <div class="example">
jetpack.future.import("slideBar");
      </div>
      <p>See <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/16">JEP 16:

    </div>
    <div name="statusBar" class="property">
      This object contains methods relevant to the status bar that
      appears at the bottom of the browser window. Note that the user
      has the option to disable the display of the status bar in
      Firefox's "View" menu.
      <div name="append" class="property">
        <div class="argument options" name="options">
          <span class="string" name="html">The initial HTML contents
          of the new status bar panel.</span>
          <span class="url" name="url">The URL of the status bar
          panel's HTML contents.</span>
          <span class="number" name="width">Size of the content area to render
          <tt>html</tt> or <tt>url</tt>, in pixels.</span>
          <span class="function" name="onReady">The callback function
          to invoke when the new panel is created on a status
          bar.</span>
        </div>
        This function adds a new panel to the status bar of all
        open browser windows. When any new browser windows open,
        the panel is automatically added to them as well.
        <p>
        The following example embeds an icon into the status bar that,
        when clicked, displays a notification message to the user.
        <div class="example">
jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: '<img src="http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico">',
  width: 16,
  onReady: function(doc) {
    $(doc).find("img").click(function() {
      jetpack.notifications.show("hai2u");
      });
  }});
        </div>
        <p>
        Technically speaking, the status bar panel is an
        <tt>iframe</tt> element. While this comes at a relatively high
        resource cost, it also enables the full breadth of
        generativity that the Web has to offer. In the future, we may
        add additional parameters to this function allowing the
        addition of simpler, less resource-intensive elements such as
        static text labels and images.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div name="storage" class="property">
      This object contains everything related to permanent and temporary storage.
      <div name="simple" class="property">
        See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/11">Simple
        Persistent Storage JEP</a>.
        <p>
        The simple storage is sandboxed to each Jetpack, so that you never
        have to worry about collisions with
        somebody else's code.
        <p>
        Here's a quick example of how to use the simple storage API:
        <p>
        <div class="example">
jetpack.future.import("storage.simple");
var myStorage = jetpack.storage.simple;
myStorage.forever = { hello: "world" };
        </div>
        <p>
        And then later:
        <div class="example">
jetpack.future.import("storage.simple");
console.log(jetpack.storage.simple.forever.hello);
        </div>
        <p>
        That's all there is to it!  Simply treat the
        <tt>jetpack.storage.simple</tt> object the same way you would any
        regular JavaScript object.  The properties attached to it will
        automatically be saved.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div name="live" class="property">
        You can attach any object to <tt>jetpack.storage.live</tt> and it will
        be available
        for you to use until Firefox is restarted. For example: <div class="example">
jetpack.storage.live.myData = {hello: "world"};
console.log( jetpack.storage.live.myData );          
          </div>
      </div>
      
    </div>  

    <div name="clipboard" class="property">
      This object provides access to the system clipboard.
      See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/10">Clipboard
        JEP</a> for a complete API reference.
      <p>
      Here's a quick example demonstrating how to set and get text from the
      clipboard.
      <div class="example">
jetpack.future.import("clipboard");
jetpack.clipboard.set("So long and thanks for all the fish!");
console.log(jetpack.clipboard.get());
      </div>
    </div>

    <div name="notifications" class="property">
      Eventually, this object will be the end-all be-all of easy
      communication with your users. Notification bars, transparent
      messages, Growls, doorknob messages, and so forth will all go
      through here. For now, it just has simple notifications.
      <div name="show" class="property">
        <div class="argument options string" name="options">
          <span class="string" name="title">The title of the notification.</span>
          <span class="url" name="icon">The URL to the notification's icon.</span>
          <span class="string" name="body">The body of the notification.</span>
        </div>
        This function displays a simple notification message. On
        Windows and Linux it's a toaster notification, and on OS X
        it's a Growl message (if Growl is installed).  Instead of
        passing in an <tt>options</tt> object, the caller can simply
        pass in a string, which is used as the <tt>body</tt> argument.
        <p>
        The following example displays a message with a title, icon,
        and body.
        <div class="example">
jetpack.notifications.show({title: 'hai2u',
                            body: 'o hai.',

    A <em>live event binder</em> is a method of a parent object,

    notified whenever the relevant event is fired on any member of the
    live array, <i>even if the member wasn't in the live array when
    the event binding was created</i>. For an example of this, see
    <tt>jetpack.tabs.onReady</tt>.

    Every live event binder method itself has a method called
    <tt>unbind</tt>, which can be passed a callback to unbind. For an
