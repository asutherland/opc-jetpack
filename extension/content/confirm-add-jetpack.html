        <div id="errorShortDesc">
	  <p>You are about to instal a Jetpack feature from an unknown, untrusted third-party source at <a id="targetLink"></a>. If you install, this feature could do <i>anything it wants</i> to your browser. It could steal your credit card number or e-mail your grandmother your entire image browsing history.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="errorLongDesc">
          <p>Here is the JavaScript source code to the feature:</p>

          <div id="sourceCode" style="max-height: 40em; overflow: auto;">
            <i>Loading code, please wait...</i>
          </div>

          <p>If you understand JavaScript, you should read this and
            use your best judgement to decide whether the feature is
            something that's safe to execute or not. Proceed at your
            own risk!</p>

          <p>If you don't understand JavaScript, you should not
            install the feature unless the link was given to you
            by someone you know and trust.</p>

            <p>In the future, we plan to have a widget here displaying
              what we call a &quot;social trust network&quot;.  You'll
              be able to see whether any of your friends have tried
              out this feature.  They can either vouch for the
              feature's safety or leave a warning about the feature's
              dangers.  We hope this will help people make informed
              decisions about whether to install Jetpack features or
              not.</p>

            people who have access to change this code on the server
            that it's hosted on.</p>
