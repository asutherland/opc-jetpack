Installing Jetpack
-------------------

To install Jetpack for development purposes to your default Firefox
profile, just enter the root directory of your Jetpack source code
checkout and run:

  python manage.py install

If you have a separate profile that you'd prefer to install the
extension under, such as 'testing', you can add that as an optional
parameter:

  python manage.py install --profile=testing

Using Jetpack
-------------

Once Jetpack has been installed, you should be able to start up
Firefox and the 'about:jetpack' page should load. Just read the
instructions from there.

Uninstalling Jetpack
--------------------

Just run "python manage.py uninstall", optionally specifying a profile
name if necessary, just like you did with the 'install' target.
Alternatively, you can also uninstall the extension through the normal
Firefox addon management UI.

Building an XPI
---------------

To build an XPI for Jetpack, just run:

  python manage.py xpi

This will create an XPI with the name "jetpack-<version>.xpi", where
"<version>" is taken from the contents of the "em:version" element in the
"extension/install.rdf" file.
